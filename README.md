# Word Filter
A word filter I made for my discord bot but it didn't work as well as I would have liked so i made this giant word filter.  
If anyone has any idea on improving this reach out on discord (GamBar#6498), nothing is overkill anymore.  

> If you want a quick list of bad words to test it with see [List of Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words)

It uses:
- Unicode's [confusables](https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt) security list with some modifications
- [Metaphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone) phonetic algorithm [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metaphone)
- [Stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stemmer)
- [Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) string comparison [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-comparison)
